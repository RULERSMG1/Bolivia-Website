        <p>The Carnaval in Cochabamba is the biggest festival in Bolivia. It happens around december every year. It started off as a very religious festival. It still holds religious traditions but it has turned into a more festival celebration throughout the country. Many folkloric dances and costumes are shown to the public in the form of a parade. It is a lot of fun to watch. The entertainers are very nice to the crowd and at times make the crowd be part of the festival. There are also many vendors selling whistles, horns, toys, light up wristbands, food, beverages and many other things. It is a very beautiful and happy time of the year for bolivia. the festival is in the span of a week. Another great tradition along with the carnaval is the throwing of water balloons. People from each side of the street get into massive balloon fights and when i mean massive...oh, I really mean a massive balloon fight. At times it can become very dangerous as some people freeze the balloons up so touristd are to be cautious during this time of the year.</p>
