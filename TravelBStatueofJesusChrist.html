        <p>The Statue of Jesus Christ is a giant statue that is located on a mountain in Cochabamba. it looks over the city as if it were protecting it and many people living there say that it really is. construction of the statue began on July 12, 1987 and was finalized on Novermber 20 1994. it was modeled after CHrist the redemmer which is the Statue that stands out looking in Rio De Janeiro in Brazil. The statue is called "El Cristo de la Concordia". The statue stands at 2,840.00 meters making it the largest Jesus Christ statue in the world. there are two types of transporation. you can take the cable car which will take you from the ground all the way up to the statue. or you can go up the stairs all the way to the top. this would be some great excersize especially after eating all of the delicious food that Bolivia has to offer.</p>
