        <p>The Uyuni salt flats, also called "Salar de Uyuni" in spanish is the world's largest salt flat at 10,582 square kilometers. It is located in the Daniel Campos Province in Potos√≠ in southwest Bolivia, near the crest of the Andes and is at an altitude of 3,656 meters (11,995 ft) above sea level. the name Uyuni comes from an indigenous dialect called Aymara. Uyuni in Aymara translates to enclosure because the whole arera is enclosed by mounatains. It is one of the most fascinating and most beautiful locations to visit in the world. People describe it as the worlds mirror because at certain times of the year, the sun will reflect on the salt and make it appear as a giant mirror that is below you.</p>
